# Data Structures and Algorithms Review

Today is our chance to look back over all the Data Structures and Algorithms we've learned.

We'll go over whiteboarding strategies and computational thinking tips.

We'll look at how to tease out when a particular Data Structure or Algorithm is the best fit.

We'll review Big O and consider what to do when we're using a core language feature with unknown space/time complexity.

 Big O worst case scenario for a hashmap is a LinkedList


### Write a function called scrape that will take a url and for each link it find it will create a folder with an index.html with the contents of that link IF that page has links else it will create a file called link_name.html in the folder of the index page which contained it's link it will follow the links and repeat this process.
