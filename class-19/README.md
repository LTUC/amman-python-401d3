# Automation

One of the most popular uses of Python is automation.

What might you want to automate? As much as possible of course!

As a developer, if you find yourself doing the same manual steps repeatedly then stop for a second and think if the upfront cost of automation could pay off.

## Notes

What to automate?

- Classifying downloaded files
- Repetitive tasks
  - Processing batch jobs or daily jobs
  - Extracting structured data from unstructured data periodically
- Run tests on each push / commit

If I have to do something more than three times, I consider writing code for it.
Some tasks are so fast to do that it may not be worth it if you don't do them often.
Some tasks are difficult to automate so that process may not be worth it because it may take more time to automate than to do manually repeatedly
