# React 1

Django has the ability to render client side web pages nicely. But an increasingly popular stack is develop your APIs using Django REST Framework and use ReactJS on the client side.

So it's time to dive back into JavaScript and learn React.

#### Describe and Define

- Single Page Application (SPA)
- JSX
- React Components
- Application state

#### Execute

- Create a React application
- Render React elements
- Pass data via props
- Handle application state
- Handle user input

## DSA Questions
- Recursion *
- Multiple Pointers *
- Big O 
    - Space ignore the input size
    - focus on auxilary space used in the algorithm
    -  Time  
    - BFS Graph *
    - With recursion, always add space for each recursive function call

Deque - Double Ended Queue

FIFO

add -> R ...  F <- remove

  add, remove E ..... E add, remove

  add, add E ..... E
  remove, remove E ...... E

  Simulate a stack

  Graph traversal I might want to do BFS or DFS so if I have a Deque then I can use it as a stack or a queue depending on which traversal I need.
