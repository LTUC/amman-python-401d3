# Notes From Feedback

## Data Structures and Algorithms go hand in hand

These considerations are important because we don't have infinitely faster or infinite memory.
In the real world we have constraints that we need to work within.

e.g. You are building an application for a smart watch, you need a search function for some aspect of your application. Memory is in short supply. How would evaluate if your solution is a good fit for the application?

We choose based on space complexity, lower is better O(1), O(log n) and trade of for a longer time complexity.

Your built in language data structures already implement some of these DS and many built-in functions implement the Algorithms we cover.

### Checking if a node is present in a tree

To check if a node is present you check from the parent.

Assuming you have assigned the parent node to root then:

```
If the node you are looking for should have been on the left then check:

if root.left not None

If the node you are looking for should have been on the right then check:

if root.right not None
```
### Adding a node to a tree
```
You add to a tree by assigning your new node to the left or right of some node that is already in the tree.

Which node you chose or weather it goes to the left or right will be based on the strategy you are implementing for adding nodes to the tree.
```

# Intro to Machine Learning

"Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

As computing resources become cheaper we can "train" our algorithms do make predictions or decisions without being explicitly  programmed to do do." - Wikipedia

In the old days the the cost of computing power was prohibitive, so it was expensive to allow our algorithms to "learn by doing."
