# Next.js

Next.js is a framework that builds on top of React and can streamline many aspects of React development.

#### Execute

- Create a Next.js powered application
- Navigate to dynamically generated pages
- Use shared components for layout
- Fetch data at build time and run time

## Today's Outline
- [ ] Deployment Options
- [ ] React Fetching Data in React
- [x] Be prepared for
 - 1 on 1s over next few days
 - Career Prep Today
 - Career Presentation Thursday
- [x] Lab 44 usually removed but I think you can benefit from it. Problem Solving and Root Case Analysis
    - This will also serve to give persons who are below 90 an opportunity to gain more grades to pass the course
- [x] Final Interviews
    - Order will be given over the weekend and early next week.
    - You do not get to choose your interviewer.
    - You camera and mic must be on so please find a way to get a quiet hour (if you are at work make preparations)
    - You do not get to choose your question, it could be from graphs, trees, hashmaps or dynamic programming.
    - Remember to work with graphs and trees you need BFS and DFS
    - Work out why you need stack for DFS and queue for BFS
    - Have a good understanding of what data structure you can use to avoid visiting the same node twice
    - Is it always the same data structure? Is it different if we want to return the traversal list  vs if we just want to make sure we didn't visit this node before
    - Some graph problem, break down into tree problems and some tree problems break down into a linked list, think about what questions you can ask your interviewer to tease this out
    - Basically you need to understand everything, identify your weakness and work to fix it, practice leetcode etc, don't just read and don't just copy code.
    - If you fail there is one retake but it may fall during your project week, which sucks.
    - Mocks so far biggest mistake is not using the visuals to help solve the problem.
     - Visualing in input and output is great but it is not all you can do
     - Visualise the simple case first, if you can solve for 1 you can usually repeat to find to general solution
     - Visualise a general case with gotchas, don't just choose one example of the problem because it may be an edge case and you can miss the general solution. Time management is key don't make it too hard but don't make it so easy you get it wrong
     - Understand the problem and figure out how to solve it by hand. This is your starting point for your algorithm
     - You don't need to write unit test code for how you would test, you can talk about what cases you would use and why they are good choices
- [x] Final Projects
    - Next week you can start thinking about your project. You will use Django rest framework, React and TailwindCss or Headless UI (Formerly Tailwind UI)
    - This is a coding bootcamp so as usual each person must commit code to the project
    - If you commit most of the code to the project and let your teammates do non-coding tasks you will lose marks
    - If you commit no code to the project you will receive 0 for all coding related areas in the project.
